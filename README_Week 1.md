# Week 1 – Machine Learning Foundations (Iris Classification)

This repository contains my Week 1 work for the **COMP5004 Machine Learning** module.
The focus of this week was understanding the structure of a basic machine learning pipeline rather than building complex models.

# Topics covered
- What machine learning is and where it is used
- Supervised vs unsupervised learning
- The machine learning pipeline
- Basic exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Training and evaluating a simple classifier

# Dataset
The classic **Iris dataset** from `sklearn.datasets` was used.
This is a small, well-known dataset commonly used for introducing classification problems.

# Model
- Algorithm: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Features: Sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width
- Evaluation metric: Accuracy

# Notes
The notebook is based on starter material provided as part of the module.
Additional comments, explanations, and small experiments (such as varying the number of neighbors in KNN) were added to reinforce understanding ofcore concepts.
This work reflects my learning process during the audit of the module rather than an attempt to optimise or deploy a production model.
